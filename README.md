## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

    `The create a course feature for instructors was complex given the amount of data and screens required to implement, but it was satisfying to see the object the process created successfully pushed up to the backend.
`

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

    `Mostly minor errors - typos, incomplete initializers and other bugs, that caused the networking and JSON decoding to fail.  The process to fix was essentially stepping through the code line by line to find the failure point.`
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.
