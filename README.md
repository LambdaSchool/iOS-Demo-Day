## Slide Requirements

1. 40 pt font minimum
2. Prefer concise words using 3-6 bullets (Don't write sentences/paragraphs)
3. Do the squint test (can you read the text if you squint, if so, make the font bigger)
4. Images are always welcome

### Optional Slides

1. Blooper: What's a funny bug or blooper? (screenshots/GIFs please)
2. Revenue Model: If the app was your sole source of income, how would you monetize it?

## Questions (Answer inline)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?
  picking an image at a given time inside a video as snapshot because I feel like being able to pick out a segment of a video has a lot of fun application.
  
2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?
  text misplacing and slowing down the performance when recreating the gif with text. This bug happened because of scaling and resolution, as well as position difference due to size difference of image and imageview. With the help of Paul, we were able to figure out the position and correct it.
  
3. Are you proud of a code file? Why?
  I am very proud of the code file because I took the time to organize them in a readable way and also developed a lot of functions that I didn't know I could do with codes.
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)
  Gif maker is an app that allows you to convert from video to gif. It allows you to turn your video into a looping gif as well as letting you add text to spice up your gif. And the best part is you can share your gif anywhere, even as an emoji.
  
5. What is your #1 feature?
  The number one feature I want to mention is the conversion of video to gif. Some benefits of gif includes smaller files, so it’s easier to store and share. Also it’s fun to share a looping gif as an emoji with your friend.
  
6. What are you future goals?
  adding video recording and online storage
