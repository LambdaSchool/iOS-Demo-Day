## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

    `I liked the process of finding out how to retrieve a collection of live photos and working with an app cache since it was an entirely self-driven learning process`

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

`2020-07-31 11:03:58.084249-0700 GIFer[2631:686642] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Error copying image to create gif'
 I I was struggling due to using an external library since there is no inbuilt system to convert live photos to gifs
 I I was not able to fix this bug.
`
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

private func getAssetThumbnail(_ asset: PHAsset, for cell: CreateCollectionViewCell) {
        let options = PHLivePhotoRequestOptions()
        let manager = PHImageManager.default()
        
      manager.requestLivePhoto(for: asset,
                             targetSize: CGSize(width: 80.0, height: 80.0),
                             contentMode: .aspectFit,
                             options: options,
                             resultHandler: { result, _ -> Void in
                                
                                if let result = result {
                                    cell.setLivePhoto(livePhoto: result)
                                }
      })
}

Took a while to figure out how to load assets from PhotoKit
    
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

`This app lets you turn your motion photos into a GIF so you can share via text or facebook and let other people see your motion photos`
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

`Not working.`
  
6. What are you future goals?

`Revisit the PhotoKit API to figure out why .mov files generates from livephotos don't work but .mov files recorded natively do`

## Required Slides (Add your Keynote to your PR)

## Presentation Format

**7 minutes/team**

* 3 minutes of questions

We have ~12 teams presenting today — please practice your presentation with a timer (as a team), and make sure you fit within the time limit.

Plan on having one person present the slides and live demo. Please practice your presentation in front of a mirror or with your team 2-5 times. Have the app running and visible (Simulator or QuickTime) so you can quickly transition between slides and live demo.
