## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

    `Tag details screen; it just feels really nice in terms of UX!`

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

    `Working with Realm was a whole new world, and numerous bugs came up along the way. Working through them was difficult because the way it does things is rather strange.`
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

    `MainCoordinator.swift; using the coordinator pattern rather than segues was something I was very happy about, as that pattern really helps to separate the concern of UI flow from View Controllers' view layout.`
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

    `Task management apps are a dime a dozen, but few apps do much to help you with prioritizing what to do now. TaskProjector not only tracks your tasks, projects, and due dates, but will also give you a suggested order of accomplishing your tasks based on due date, time estimate, tags, and other optional task properties. You can also see available nearby tasks by adding a location to your tags.`
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

    `The app gives you a suggested order to do your tasks in based on due date, time estimate, and creation date.`
  
6. What are you future goals?
    * Add tags, areas, projects
    * Recurring tasks
    * Smarter 'next tasks' algorithm
    * Adjustable 'nearby' radius
    * Improve UI
    * Sequential vs. parallel projects
    * Syncing
    * View completed tasks
    * Notes
    * Habit tracking
    * Peer to peer sharing and accountability
    * User notifications

## Required Slides (Add your Keynote to your PR)

1. App Name / Team Slide
2. Elevator Pitch
3. Demo

## Slide Requirements

1. 50 pt font minimum
2. Be concise — don't write sentences/paragraphs (put these in your slide notes for speaking)
3. 3-6 bullets maximum per slide
4. Do the squint test (can you read the text if you squint, if so, make the font bigger)
6. Images are always welcome
7. Do the Grandma Test (Would your Grandma understand you?)

### Optional Slides

1. Blooper: What's a funny bug or blooper? (screenshots/GIFs please)
2. Revenue Model: If the app was your sole source of income, how would you monetize it?

## Presentation Format

Plan on having one person present the slides and live demo. Please practice your presentation in front of a mirror or with your team 2-5 times. Have the app running and visible (Simulator or QuickTime) so you can quickly transition between slides and live demo.
