# iOS Demo Day

**7 minutes/team**

* 4 minute presentation (5 minute hard cap)
* 3 minutes of questions

We have 12 teams presenting today — please practice your presentation with a timer (as a team), and make sure you fit within the time limit.

## Requirements

Fork and clone this repository and tag your TL and instructor on your Pull Request.

Add your: 

1. Slide deck (4 required slides in Keynote)
2. Video demo (2 minutes max), share YouTube video link
3. Answer all the questions

The video demo is for sharing your work on your portfolio, but it is also a fallback if you have a technical issue during demo time.

## Required Slides (Add your Keynote to your PR)

1. App Name / Team Slide
2. Elevator Pitch
3. Your #1 Feature (Customer facing — what can I do with your app?)
4. Future Goals

## Slide Requirements

1. 40 pt font minimum
2. Prefer concise words using 3-6 bullets (Don't write sentences/paragraphs)
3. Do the squint test (can you read the text if you squint, if so, make the font bigger)
4. Images are always welcome

### Optional Slides

1. Blooper: What's a funny bug or blooper? (screenshots/GIFs please)
2. Revenue Model: If the app was your sole source of income, how would you monetize it?

## Questions (Answer inline)

1. **What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?** Implementing the stepper on the show list cells. Making it automatically go to the next season when blank seasons are allowed was a fun challenge.
2. **What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?** Layout constraints were a slightly bigger issue than I had expected. The original constraints I had did not translate to smaller screens such as the iPhone SE, but I fixed it by being more intentional and logical with my constraint usage, rather than just throwing in things that looked good in preview on the specific device size I had selected.
3. **Are you proud of a code file? Why?** As mentioned in my response to question 1, my show list cells have a lot of relatively complex code to present everything as intended. It took me many tries and iterations to get it all working with the optional seasons feature, and I'm proud of how it ended up working out.
4. **What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)** This app allows you track your current episode and season in TV shows you're watching and gives estimates for how long it will take you to either finish a series or catch up before a new season of a series before it's released. You can easily mark episodes as watched, view number of episodes remaining, and view estimated watch time from all of your shows from the list on the main screen.
5. **What is your #1 feature?** Being able to see an estimated watch time from the main screen that updates dynamically based on current episode while ignoring any seasons you plan to skip.
6. **What are you future goals?** Adding support to sort shows based on either watch time or next season release date. A much more ambitious goal would be adding an online database so users can download popular show information without having to manually input it all themselves.
