## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

   **Mark: I like incorporating imoji's in the work because it adds a visual pop and makes up for my lack of creative skills.**

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

    **Mark: I had a segue/navigation controller/storyboard issue that proved to be quite vexing. It involved a lot of mythotical searching of all the places in the code used to get his working and find the proper places to put identifiers.**
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

    **Mark: I liked my idea of throwing the warning triangle in the upper-right of the main view if you declined notifications.**
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

    **Countdown Timer is a way to enter timers (like an egg timer), birthdays, and appointments. You can tag items however you like: Home, Work, School, or your own tag. Filter by tag and view a history of old timers. Alerts will pop-up on your phone even if it's locked.**
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

    **Mark: Watching the timers count down.**
  
6. What are you future goals?

    **Mark: Tags as tags and not strings. Improve the fit and finish. Turn notifications on/off per timer**
