## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

    Display funny quotes when tapping on the image. Because it makes user smile(maybe).

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

   Managed to perform segue from swipe left button to edit the cell's data. Fixed by changing the sender to IndexPath.
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

  
    ```
    dateFormatter.dateFormat = sender.isOn ?  "E, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss" : "E, d MMM yyyy
    ``` 
    Switch the dateFormat depend on switch state. I like this better than "if else" .
