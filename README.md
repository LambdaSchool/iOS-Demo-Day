# iOS Demo Day

**7 minutes/team**

* 4 minute presentation (5 minute hard cap)

We have 12 teams presenting today — please practice your presentation with a timer (as a team), and make sure you fit within the time limit.

Add your: 

1. Slide deck (4 required slides in Keynote)
2. Video demo (2 minutes max), share YouTube video link
3. Answer all the questions

The video demo is for sharing your work on your portfolio, but it is also a fallback if you have a technical issue during demo time.

## Required Slides (Add your Keynote to your PR)

1. App Name / Team Slide
2. Elevator Pitch
3. Your #1 Feature (Customer facing — what can I do with your app?)
4. Future Goals

## Slide Requirements

1. 40 pt font minimum
2. Prefer concise words using 3-6 bullets (Don't write sentences/paragraphs)
3. Do the squint test (can you read the text if you squint, if so, make the font bigger)
4. Images are always welcome

### Optional Slides

1. Blooper: What's a funny bug or blooper? (screenshots/GIFs please)
2. Revenue Model: If the app was your sole source of income, how would you monetize it?

## Questions (Answer inline)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?
    My favorite feature was the uploading photos feature. I think it's a really neat feature to be able to access the pictures in you phone from an app, as well as really useful. For the person using the app, it will be very important for them not to mix thier medications up, so an image of the pill or the pill bottle will help people not make a simple but potentially devistating mistake.

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?
    My biggest obstacle was setting the alarm's to go off to the time selected by the user from the date picker. I had to figure out how to set the time selected which was a date in to date components.

3. Are you proud of a code file? Why?
    Possibly, I haven't been able to see if it functions properly yet (in theory it should). In the CollectionViewController file, I added a border to my cells to make them a little more readable. I also added in a color change feature that should change the border color from black to red when the current time is equal to the time that the medication is supposed to be taken.

4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)
    This is an app to track and remind people to take their medications. By adding a medication, with it's dosage, an image, and any special instructions for taking this medicine, they also set a reminder that will go off when it's time for them to take their medicine

5. What is your #1 feature?
    Again I feel like my number one feature is the uploading photos feature. I think it's very useful to the user and makes it much easier for them to know which medicine they're taking.

6. What are you future goals?
    Letting the users change the size of the collection view cells would be my next goal for this app. The cells arent very big right now, so having an option to make them more visible would help out a lot of visually impaired users. Also some medications need to be taken more than once a day, so adding in a featue to set multiple timers for a medication would also be very useful.
