## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

`The tab bar controller. It was challenging to implement but really brought the project together once it was ready.`

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

`It was difficult to align all of our seperate ideas into a single project and form a clear goal early on.`
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

    `if (postLat <= (usersLat + 1.0) && postLat >= (usersLat - 1.0)) && (postLong <= (usersLong + 1.0) && postLong >= (usersLong - 1.0))  {
        parsedPosts.append(post)
    }
    
    It was difficult to work through this logic, but it successfully filters the posts to only show if it is within 1 degree of the users Latitude and Longitude`
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

`As technology continues to integrate into our social lives, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stay in touch with local communites. This app provides an easy to access message board for just those in your area.`
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

`Our #1 feature is the ability to only see posts from people within your area`
  
6. What are you future goals?

`1. Allow the user to choose the filter distance.
2. Allow the user to filter based on tags
3. Incorporate a map to allow users to pinpoint events`
