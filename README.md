## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

    My favorite feature to implement was using JSON Data with a pickerview. It saved me from writing a ton of code. Since the values of the currency aren't hardcoded, the app is able to stay up date by grabbing the info from the internet. 

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

    My biggest obstacle was the picker view not obtaining the JSON data that was being passed through it consistently. I had to use DispatchQueue when reloading the picker view. Afterwards it worked consistently every time.
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

    I don't have a lot of experience with JSON. So being able to figure out how to grab data that's layered was an accomplishment for me. 
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

    Converency is a simple and efficient currency converter. It provides up-to-date exchange rates, not only for foreign currencies, but for Bitcoin as well. Perfect for when you plan to travel abroad, or if you're interested in Cryptocurrency. With it's simple User Interface, using the app will be a breeze.   
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

    My #1 feature is the up-to-date exchange rates. 
  
6. What are you future goals?

    Add the ability to convert between different currencies. Right now you can only convert from USD.
