Questions (Answer inline)

    What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?
        The priority algorithm cause I got it to work like I originally planned.

    What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?
        After all the priority algoritm was coded, it still didn't sort. I saved
        the result of that math into a property of each show, and that way I was
        able to use the sort functionality like I did with sorting alphabetically.

    Are you proud of a code file? Why?
        The calculationSettings file of course. That's the one containing the 
        priority algorithm.

    What is your elevator pitch?
        This app is perfect for organizing you favorite shows in one place. It 
        keeps track of the premier date of next season for all shows, plus How
        far along the current season you are. Also, when sorted by priority, it
        will always suggest the show that has the most priority on top.

    What is your #1 feature?
         The priority sorting.

    What are you future goals?
        Getting the sorting to split the cells in to 3 sections:
            -  sorted by closest premier date 
            -  sorted by current Season progress
            - sorted by both (what we have now)
