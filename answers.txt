1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?
 My favorite feature to implement was notifications it was my first time 
 Working with them in iOS and it was a lot of fun getting learn about them 	   


   



2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?
  The biggest obstacle I had was when I first tried to create an entry I ran the app
  And it would just crash on start so I spent half a day fixing that issue only to find
  Out it was a simple error that was being caused cause I had something missed named 		





3. Are you proud of a code file? Why?

   Yes all the files are cleanly written and look very nice and the all the app files are well organized 






4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)
    
   My elevator pitch -
Ever want to keep a journal but books take up to much space and you more often then not 
Forget to even right in the thing? Well the Countability tracker is the app for you write and save a journal entry with a title and it will send a notification reminding you to write in the Journal   





5. What is your #1 feature?

My #1 feature is the notification the app will send telling the user that it is time to write about the day.







6. What are you future goals?

My future goals for this are as follows 
#1 let the user decide the time they have the notification sent at 
#2 add in a dark mode setting button to change the background for easy nighttime use 
#3 add in a user login/signup since I'm using a database as a backup to keep items saved
